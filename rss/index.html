The aim of getting into Linux kernel development would be either profit or fun or even both. These are the main reasons why people get into Linux kernel development while it would not be surprising to find someone who got into Linux kernel development primarily to make a difference in open source. It is a tough road out there so a good reason will keep you motivated all the way. </p><p>One of the ways to get started with Linux kernel development is to fix bugs and regressions in the kernel. You could start with fixing easy bugs and progress to harder ones as you gain skill and experience. Hacking on the Linux kernel(which contains some of the best written open source code) could also help a lot in improving your C programming/development skills. There are two places where one can find bugs that they could possibly fix in the Linux kernel. These places are <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">syzkaller</a> and <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/regressions/">regressions mailing list.</a> </p><p>syzkaller is a fuzzing bot developed by the fuzzing team at Google. There are numerous other tools developed by the same team at Google. Some of these are in-kernel instrumentation like KMSAN, KCSAN, and KASAN. All the three tools assist with finding memory corruption bugs in the kernel but KMSAN and KCSAN have yet to be merged into the Linux kernel. It is also considered to be a bug when warnings and other instrumentation built into the kernel like the BUG are hit when fuzzing. KMSAN, KCSAN, and KASAN allow for syzkaller to detect bugs such as use-after-free, use of uninitialized variables in code, out-of-bounds access, and race conditions. Another tool that syzkaller relies on is kmemleak which allows for detecting memory leaks.</p><p>On the other hand, the regressions list contains issues that have been reported to be affecting recent kernels but were not affecting older kernels or, in other words, bugs that were introduced. These are also sometimes easy to fix as you can bisect and pick the offending commit and then analyze the change and how it introduced the said regression. For both cases, patches developed should be sent over to the relevant mailing list for review and possible merging into the mainline Linux kernel.</p><p>To debug the Linux kernel, one can take the approach of reproducing the bugs or diving very deep into the related code to figure out the issue from a code perspective. Both reproducing the bug and diving into related code can be very hard. For reproducing you have to get a kernel, compile it with the appropriate <em>.config, </em>load it onto a virtual machine which you connect to via a debugger, run the reproducer and finally use the debugger to break and step into relevant code. This can be a very painstaking setup especially when it has to be done for each and every bug differently. For a virtual machine and debugger, one can use the Qemu-kvm and gdb which works pretty well for kernel debugging.</p><p>The other approach would be to interpret the stacktrace(which to some extent is already interpreted in the syzkaller bug reports) and read the code related to the functions in the stacktrace using a text editor(like vim, which works very well). Use GNU grep to follow functions through the code and establish points at which they are called. In most stacktraces, the code is being called as a result of an interrupt, either software or hardware. This approach is not easy either as you might find yourself opening more than 10 terminal windows and trying to make sense of the code.</p><p>Once one establishes what the cause of the issue is, the next step would be identifying the root cause and fixing the bug from there. This is especially very difficult even for presumably easy bugs like uninit-value. A more serious underlying issue will usually be the cause of the unexpectedly uninitialized variable. To demonstrate that this is fairly hard, I will use an example of a bug I tried to fix. I did, yes, manage to silence the fuzzing tools but the patch I developed did not look like something I could send to the Linux kernel mailing list.</p><p>To demonstrate the above, we are going to inspect and try to fix one bug. The bug is <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=fb453bc21cf8eb5cd3ba91406b5d22e8915cf299">uninit -value in sctp_inq_pop</a>. From the stacktrace it can be seen that some variable in </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/336dd883474d186f4b2afa3394a3718c.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>is uninitialized.</p><p>The value chunk_end is stored here and later used a few lines further into the function in the code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/3344fc504603e119122fc6914def10f3.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>which triggers the uninit-value error.</p><p>First, it is not clear which variable exactly is uninitialized but given the two code snippets, we can safely speculate that chunk_end is uninitialized, or rather, it has been initialized from a value that was not initialized. From looking at this function further, we can tell that ch(struct sctp_chunkhdr *) is the first segment of the memory stored in data which is a member of an skb which we can tell from the stacktrace was created at:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/7e4ebd05696c06f4cfe898018707366b.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Data(the contents of another skb) are then copied onto the newly created skb further down the same function:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/59c0493bbb3348ca57510cb3c7cd6b28.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p> This would mean that the data being copied is uninitialized and this is the source of our issue. It means an skb was created but it&apos;s header section was never initialized. This, however leads us to a dead-end because by using grep we can identify four sections of code within the sctp code that call &apos;alloc_skb&apos;. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="gholg.github.iocontent/images/2022/05/Screenshot-from-2022-05-18-12-36-13.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="811" height="122" srcset="gholg.github.iocontent/images/size/w600/2022/05/Screenshot-from-2022-05-18-12-36-13.png 600w, gholg.github.iocontent/images/2022/05/Screenshot-from-2022-05-18-12-36-13.png 811w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Our analysis hits a dead end though since none of these &apos;alloc_skb&apos; calls seem relevant to our bug. </p><p>However, it was still possible for us to confirm that the issue lies within &apos;ch-&gt;length&apos; not being set by running this patch:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/7f86f8b0e5989fa830efc3e16c835adc.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>through syzbot which managed to get the error to go away.</p><p>All in all, we did not get to the root cause of the bug since it looks like this uninitialized skb is created by some other Linux code other than sctp code. This however demonstrates that even seemingly simple uninit-value bugs could be very deeply embedded into the code and difficult to fix.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qemu AMD-Vi]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>After tonnes of blood, tears, and sweat... </p><p>I&apos;m glad to have been working on Qemu AMD IOMMU emulation as part of GSoC and to have achieved most of what was planned, that is, both a working host translation implementation and a working interrupt remapping implementation.

The code implementing this device is still under review and not yet merged into Qemu.</p><p><em>- So, what now?? - nothing, really.</em></p><p><strong>IOMMU TOPOLOGY</strong> </p><p>IOMMU is a device that sits between the host bridge and peripherals allowing them to make I/O requests bypassing the need to request CPU for access permissions. This allows the user-space applications to take full control of devices a.k.a device pass-through and is hence an important feature for virtualization. In this particular case, we are looking at nested virtualization.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="gholg.github.iocontent/images/2022/05/Screenshot-from-2022-05-13-12-36-51.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="550" height="450"><figcaption>AMD IOMMU topology</figcaption></figure><p><strong>1.2.6 &#xA0;Virtualizing the IOMMU </strong></p><p>The IOMMU has been designed so that it can be emulated in software by a VMM that wishes to present its VM guests the illusion that they have an IOMMU* &#xA0; - *AMD IOMMU Specification* This didn&apos;t turn out *so* easy. how come?!? </p><p><strong>1.</strong> IOMMU masquerades as a PCI device by stealing PCI config space so that the Software driver is able to communicate with it as with any other PCI device while it&apos;s not really a PCI device. </p><p><em>&quot;3.1 PCI Resources The IOMMU is implemented as an independent PCI Function. Any PCI Function containing an IOMMU capability block cannot be used for any purpose other than containing an IOMMU. A PCI Function containing an IOMMU capability block does not include PCI BAR registers. Configuration and status information for the IOMMU are mapped into PCI configuration space using a PCI capability block.&quot;</em> &#xA0;- <strong>AMD IOMMU Spec</strong></p><p>(Someone actually pointed this out, for me ;-p) The above becomes evident since IOMMU reserves MMIO region without a BAR register. This feature was particularly hard to emulate in Qemu since it only supports either purely PCI devices or platform devices(system bus devices). </p><p><strong>2.</strong> AMD IOMMU, while masquerading as a PCI device generates interrupts without being a BusMaster device(which is typical of PCI devices) IOMMU should generate an interrupt each time it logs an event which should include all hardware errors and page faults. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> IOMMUs(including AMD IOMMU) use device source ID (which should be the same as BDF) to index _device table_ and other informational data structures in order to make decisions on access rights and remap interrupts. Platform devices like HPET and IOAPIC don&apos;t make DMA requests, at least as long as Qemu is concerned which means that the DMA part of IOMMU can be completed without any problem. These devices are however major interrupt sources in a system which means the interrupt remapping work is a bit tricky. Interrupt requests should be accompanied by information identifying the device and the nature of the interrupt requests. Included in this information is the Requester ID which is basically the Bus Device Function(BDF) when PCI devices are concerned. Platform devices that want to make interrupt requests should report the BDF that will accompany their interrupt requests. The problem comes in because platform devices, in Qemu currently make interrupt requests using unspecified attributes meaning unspecified requester ID. </p><p><em>huh? sounds like AMD is hating on Qemu</em></p><p>The working Qemu AMD IOMMU setup implements a composite PCI/Platform device similar to the stripped down device below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/5ebf90818d233ddea806e9bd9194587f.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The above design solves two problems one being we&apos;re able to inherit from Qemu X86 IOMMU class (which is implemented as Platform device) and the other being we&apos;re able to reserve MMIO region for like any other Platform device hence avoiding the need for a BAR register.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/435cfa4762230b987964ca7bd678bbec.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p> The above code solves the lack of BusMaster capability on AMD IOMMU by writing interrupts directly to system address space Lastly, the Platform device issue was solved by affiliating x86 MSI route, which was initially </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/2c5555c5f230ce2fbdd33c4eae54e14d.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>with a MSI Requester ID to have </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/f846aad5352a62c74f56b72f6ae22592.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>which ensures that IOAPIC triggering interrupts in split irqchip mode is able to tell the IOMMU it&apos;s SID and so would any other platform device. </p><p><em>Why spend all this effort on a seemingly useless device ?</em> </p><p> Good Question</p><p> An impressive proposal for using Virtual IOMMU for inter-VM communication can be accessed here <a href="https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/kvm/Vm2vm+Mst" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/kvm/Vm2vm+Mst</a> </p><p>Interrupt remapping as an IOMMU feature enables interception, validation and delivery of interrupts to specific CPUs. Interrupt remapping together with interrupt virtualization could bring performance improvements to guest VM but interrupt remapping alone is supposed to provide device isolation, and compatibility with x2apic and could possibly be used to program a different route for delivery of an interrupt.</p><p> Device isolation allows the handing over of device to unprivileged users since with the validation of interrupts a device controlled by, say, a malicious user cannot be able to generate spurious interrupts (which is possible by just writing to MSI region) and direct them to arbitrary CPUs.This allows safe development of device drivers from userspace but could not be done with the IOMMU models with don&apos;t allow for interrupt remapping where one requires supervisor rights to passthrough devices which is not necessary with interrupt remapping. </p><p>It&#x2019;s a requirement from intel that with x2apic enabled peripheral interrupts should be delivered through interrupt remapping and lastly It _could_ be possible to reroute interrupts without reconfiguring the interrupt source by modifying the Interrupt remapping table since it contains all the information relating to routing interrupts related to a certain device. This could avoid the messy process of rerouting interrupts. </p><p><em>And maybe something else I forgot? </em></p><p>how can I test this device? </p><p>Quickly grab qemu code, compile and ... Well, at this point the device has long since been merged into Qemu and is probably available in your distros package manager.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/GholG/6098cd39ca5815a50c36f56a57c57cec.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>should start Qemu with the device emulated.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My name is David, a software developer primarily involved with open source.</p><p>I started programming and developing software in the year 2012 soon after leaving high where I left a record of being a very outstanding student.
